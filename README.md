# ReceiveIt Server

Server running on a Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W to receive files over network and present them as a mass storage usb device to the host computer.

Device needs to use network and bluetooth for app functionality, so shell access needs to be enabled via usb serial interface. Since g_mass_storage and g_serial are mutually exclusive, it is required to use libcomposite/configfs to manage serial + mass storage.
